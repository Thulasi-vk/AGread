Description: Standardize the process of bringing various modes of output files
    into R. For more information, see: <https://actigraph.desk.com/customer/en/
    portal/articles/2515800-what-do-the-different-mode-numbers-mean-in-a-csv-or-
    dat-file->. Additionally, processes are provided to read and minimally pre-
    process raw data from primary accelerometer and inertial measurement unit files.
    ActiGraph monitors are used to estimate physical activity outcomes via body-worn
    sensors that measure (e.g.) acceleration or rotational velocity.
